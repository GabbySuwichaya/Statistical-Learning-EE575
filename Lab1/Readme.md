## Tasks

- [5 scores] Select 5 features from house-price datasets. 
    - Pre-process the data ...
    - Show the Correlation matrix of your selected features and explain why you choose them ....  

- [15 scores] Apply the provided OLS to estimate the house-price... 
    
    - [5 scores] Measue the performance of OLS with the following measurements:
        - MAE 
        - RMSE
        - R2score
    
    - [10 scores] At this setting, compute the following scores based on the training data
        - loglikelihood.... ** We assume Gaussian case **...
        - AIC
        - BIC 

        Compare your results with loglikelihood, AIC, BIC, reported from statsmodel.sm.OLS()

- [10 scores]  Improve the performance of the OLS by one of the following methods... 
    The minimum and maximum number of features are 1 and 10.

    1. Feedforward features set selection
    2. Backwad features set selection

     
- [10 scores]  Then, you have to show how you make decision by one of the following statistics: AIC, BIC, Adj. R-squared, and the validated MSE...

- [5 scores] What ever decision you have made, please make sure that you have made the improvement on testing between the two models in terms of

    - (1). MSE
    - (2). Computational complexity 


- [5%**Extra]  If you can apply the iterative re-weight technique to improve the OLS.



After you finished, please let me know and I will mark the codes... 

You can also save your results and send them as 63xxxxxxx/Lab1/main.ipynb
