- [3 scores] Task 1. Neural Network Quiz
 
- [17 scores] Static NN Implementations  ... 
    
    1. [4 scores, if the model is correct] The first 3-5 layers are linear layers  + 1 activation (you can choose any function)

    2. [4 scores, if the data loading is correct]  Choose 5-10 features as the inputs (also gives the reason why) and 1 output for the house price. 

    3. [1 scores, if the data spliting is correct]  Split the `house-price` datasets into training 80% and testing 20%. In the training part, divide 10% of the training data for validation. 

    4. [3+3 scores, if the learning is correct] Show the progress of the training and validation losses.  

    5. [2 scores, if the results are reasonable] Perform the evaluation using MSE, MAE, and R^2 
    
 After you finished, please let me know and I will mark the codes...  


- [40 scores Homeworks]  BNN Implementations and compare with Static NN Homework

    1. [15 scores] BNN Model  
        - Bayesian Linear Model 
        - Bayesian Linear Layer
        - Gaussian Mixture Prior + any other auxiliary functions

    2. [10 scores] Training 
        - ELBO loss is correct 
        - Sampling is correct

    3. [4 scores] validation after each training 
        - Use reasonable measure to guage the results.

    4. [3+3 scores, if the learning is correct] Show the progress of the training and validation losses for both models.  

    5. [10 scores, if the results are reasonable] Perform the evaluation using MSE, MAE, and R^2
