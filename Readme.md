 

Our goal is to provide the code-based visualization and exercises to understand the mathematics behind each of lectures in **Statiscal Learning EE2102575** by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul*.

 
### Topics

The coding scripts & excercises are comming soon
  
### Getting Started

1. Change the directory to the `Tutorial` folder.
2. Look for the  instructions (e.g. [Tutorial 1 Readme](TutorialX/Readme.md)) for installing dependencies. 
3. You may execute the `main` file in python or ipynb fileformat. 

* Course materials (such as HW and lecture notes) maybe provided in each `Tutorial` folder. 
* Each tutorial runs independently in its own environment.
